1. Introduction

 This example demonstrates how to use UI-command base scoring
to calculate H*(10). And it is also an application for testing the 
interpolation of conversion coefficients.

1.1 Geometry and primary particle

 It has just one box in the world volume filled by G4_Galactic.
No detector in the mass geometry. Particle gun shoots a gamma/neutron(default)
in the box. Particle's energy is a fuction of its ID for test.
E=e*pow(10.,id/50.), e is the lower edge energy for conversion coefficients.
For gamma set e=1.00e-02*MeV; 
For neutron set e=1.00e-09*MeV.
Every decade 50 energy points for test. 

1.2 Physics

 The physics list is taken from referenced physics-list QGS_BIC
in Geant4.

2. Macro files and Mesh

 Use testPSH10.mac, and there is only one mesh box in the marco. The dumped
result is like testresult.txt. To Print the result of interpolation, 
uncomment the line in G4PSH10.cc::CalcConvCoeff() and recompile the library. 
 
 // G4cout << pname << " " << x << " MeV, H10_phi " << H10_phi << G4endl;

 All the other macros are reserved for comparing with Geant4 example.
One can use diff tools to find what is the difference. For example, meld.

3. Units

 The default unit of H*(10) is uSv, and can be changed into mSv or Sv
by UI command.

/score/quantity/H10 testPSH10 mSv

or

/score/quantity/H10 testPSH10 Sv
